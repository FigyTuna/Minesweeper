Minesweeper in like 100 lines of python code.

Type in your input like this: "A4" or "a4"
You must do it exactly like that or it will break. What do you expect from Minesweeper in like no lines of code?

If you want to change the size of the game, just adjust the line g = Game(<number of mines>, <length of sides>) accordingly. (It's the second to last line.)

I made this on the train using qpython3 on my phone as a way to pass the time.
